# Networking basics

## In this project, I learnt about Netcat (nc) commands and how to use the /etc/hosts file.

```
ifconfig -show IP addresses on the network
telnet - connecting to a server i.e: telnet localhost 98
nc - creating test server, listening to ports, sending files, etc i.e:nc -l
localhost 98

cut: command to filter output

```
